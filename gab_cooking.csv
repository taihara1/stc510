I also rarely make chocolate anything anymore since my spoiled pups cannot have any. Waiting patiently while the sun melts our ice and Lil bit of snow.,"Feb 04, 2022, 10:09"
1,"recipe,","About once a month, my husband and I dedicate a night to making dishes that are unique and creative to us - this year we are looking into some recipes from old cookbooks we found.Here is our review of two different desserts:Unique Date Cookies:  The dough in this recipe is great, and the filling is fine but it seems to be spread too thin. I would make again (possibly for Christmas), but either make more filling or modify the recipe as a 'thumbprint' style cookie.Tomato Soup Cake:  You read that right - this cake features a can of tomato soup, so of course I had to make it! Though the box above the recipe touts the delightfulness of 'vegetable cakes', this was the only recipe in the book. But - don't knock it till you try it! It does not have any of the 'tomato' flavor and is quite sweet (even without frosting), but this is probably one of the most moist cakes I've ever tasted. Flavor wise, it reminds me of a Depression Cake, probably from the raisins.#oldrecipes #cooking #recipes #cookbook #oldcookbook #desserts #baking #cookies #cake #tomatosoupcake #raisins #depressioncake #datecookiesRead more","Feb 04, 2022, 09:46"
2,"recipe,good,","About once a month, my husband and I dedicate a night to making dishes that are unique and creative to us - this year we are looking into some recipes from old cookbooks we found.Here is our review of a side dish and appetizer.Sauerkraut Bake: Though the recipe says 'pile hotdogs' (lol), I don't understand what this brings to the recipe other than making it an 'entree' rather than a side dish. Otherwise, if you like a sweet/sour side dish, it's surprisingly good! Just be sure to drain the sauerkraut best you can - I didn't and it turned out a bit watery.Sausage Macaroni Goulash: My hubs picked this one because it reminded him of his mother's recipe, and I had NEVER had goulash before. After making it, he said it tasted better than his mom's, but next time we'll leave out the sour cream and parsley as he prefers a more 'tomato' flavor rather than a creamy texture.#oldrecipes #cooking #sauerkraut #sausage #macaroni #goulash #hotdogs #pineapple #recipes #dinner #sidedish #cookbook #oldcookbookRead more","Feb 04, 2022, 09:46"
