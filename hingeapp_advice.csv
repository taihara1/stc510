Trauma makes you funny. Okay ? So you have serious baggage

The typical Sunday is so generic that I don't know where to begin. You like alcohol, working out and the movies... So does almost every breathing person on the app. No offense. 

The menu one doesn't even make sense. 

You're attractive enough for you to have no problem getting attention but your profile gives very little to go off of for introductions. 

Prompts should highlight your interests and what you're looking for. Which you do meh okay. But the method you do it isn't welcoming for a Convo outside of ""what movies you watching"". Try to be a bit more specific or at least have something in your profile to start a conversation.

What do you even mean by ""negotiations"" are non-negotiable? I guess that it's a joke, but unless somebody is so 100% on your comedy wavelength most women are just going to swipe left. 

Prompts that just name or list things you like, or characteristics you have are a wasted opportunity. They are wasted because they only work unless you bump into somebody who happens to like the exact same things as you, and that's not going to happen very often.

Prompts should be truthful personal opinions that are universally relatable. It's not enough to say that you like X, instead say you like X because <reason>. For example, you might like skiing because of the exhilerating buzz or the great after-ski party scene. 

You might find somebody who doesn't like skiing but loves the adrenaline rush or loves to party.

If you‚Äôre neither of those things, kill both suit pictures and replace with things that reflect your hobbies better - like a shot with your car or music related.",Positive

Similar with the prompts. The first two really make you sound arrogant / dismissive and the last just made my eyes roll so far back into my head that I'm having to type this blind.

But beyond that, I'm just not confident you're going to get the feedback you want here. Conservative and Catholic is just not the vibe of this subreddit. Like I'm a far left liberal guy with a bisexual girlfriend in a very ""hipster"" Chicago neighborhood. Not sure my opinions will be the most valuable to you, but I'll try my best.

Prompts: Get rid of all your prompts. They're actively hurting you when they should be helping. Remember this is your chance to let someone get a peek into your life. You should also frame them all in a positive connotation where most of yours are more negative leaning. I don't think you're intending to be negative, it's just something a lot of guys do when they aren't comfortable really trying to market themselves. Personally I really like the typical Sunday or I get really excited about prompts. You could also do one thing I really want to know about you, and put like ""your top 3 bands or something"" if you want to take the conversation in a musical direction.

Pictures: I would keep the first picture and fourth picture and replace the rest. Like maybe keep number 3, but I just think you can take a different cooking picture that will give off a more attractive vibe. Very often ""funny pics"" don't work well unless they also have kind of an ""aww that's adorable"" vibe as well. Like picture number 4. Beyond that, you need a couple more full body shots. Any time I don't see one, I assume there's a real insecurity or lack of confidence around their body and that's often not appealing. Also a couple more candid ones. Maybe working on your car as a picture instead of a prompt, so you can show the interest without being that guy that just needs to talk about his car. Or you at a concert if that's your thing. Also the last two I'd drop because tinted glasses or sunglasses are just a dating app no no. Nobody likes them, nobody wants them. And I just don't think a Peyton Manning statue is doing you want favors as your wingman. And the last picture just looks like you're posing with coworkers in the elevator at work, which just feels weird to me.

I know that's long, but wanted to try to be specific with my feedback as I'm sure it kind of feels like people are really piling on and I want to be constructive. Also, just remember that dating apps also skew heavily liberal, so go into it with the expectation that you're working with a smaller dating pool. Obviously this can shift a bit based on your geography, but it's something to be mindful of. 

Also just realized you're 23. I thought we were the same age and I'm in my early 30s. Not because of how you look but how you dress and present yourself.

Good first photo.


First prompt would probably make me swipe left.

The chicken picture is fun. I like it and if you really do love to cook I‚Äôd keep it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 


Ehhhh whenever people brag about their music taste I find myself unimpressed. I have met exactly one person whose taste was half as good as they said it was and he literally made playlists for Apple Music for a living. If you want to convey the music thing better then maybe use ‚Äúchange my mind about‚Äù and ‚Äú________ is a perfect song‚Äù or something. That would get me to pop open Spotify and message them my opinion if I thought a person was cute.


The lace photo is super cute and fun. Nice smile!


Pineapple on pizza‚Ä¶. Why?! So you‚Äôve told me about yourself: you won‚Äôt reply to my texts in a timely way, you think your taste in music is better than mine, and you‚Äôre condescending about the most boring possible thing to be condescending about? Damn dude, you‚Äôre cute but even without the previous dealbreaker I‚Äôd be out. 


The football photo is fine, but I bet you could get a nicer one in business casual everyday clothes with just a nice smile. That would go a long way for you I think.

This isn't me calling you one, but being conservative carries the assumption that you're a bit of a misogynist for most people, and when you're trying to date women, it's gonna turn them off of you.

I noticed you get a lot of hate for the Catholic conservative thing. I did too. Maybe consider taking conservative out and see what happens, but never ever ever take Catholic out. We want to proclaim Christ at all times, even if it is at a personal cost to ourselves,  but you also have to remember that this is Reddit, so getting hate for that might just be the biases of this site and not representative of the population of women on Hinge in your area. As for the prompts, no pineapple on pizza talk. It's a tired old meme and I don't love it, just like the Helen Keller meme which I hate. The music prompt is basic. Even if you changed it to mention your favorite kind of music, it's still pretty basic. The messaging thing should probably go. There's no ""in"" there. What I look for when liking a girl's profile is a prompt that I can say something about that adds to a conversation, and I don't think you have any particularly graceful conversation starters.

I think it‚Äôs important to take people‚Äôs comments with a grain of salt because a lot of people are providing a valuable perspective but are not well versed in the aspects of creating a profile based on OLD ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô. 

I think the photos you‚Äôve changed to are fine but the others were stronger and provided a different dynamic. I like that your original profile opened with a values based prompt instead of a hobbies/interests based because I think that‚Äôs more important. For your new profile it‚Äôs vital to avoid directive language like ‚Äúbe fit and active‚Äù because it comes off as passive aggressive and standard-setting. I hear you, that‚Äôs my ideal partner too, but we need to vet that on our own. Filter on your profile through things like seeking a serious relationship and values like compassion and empathy, not physical traits. 

That said, both of your profiles are soundly above average and will work just fine for OLD. It can be fun to craft the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô profile but there‚Äôs definitely diminishing returns at some point. Ultimately I think your *best* profile lies somewhere between these two where you find the key balance between displaying your values and interests (see my prompt guide for this) and tailoring your profile to what type of match you‚Äôre looking for (see bacons prompt guide for this). 

Finally, a small place I think you could add more is by captioning a couple photos. Did you like the legs photo? You should use it. Throw a little caption in there to let it speak more. Are those your dogs in the sledding photo? Let us know that. I would have assumed you don‚Äôt have dogs based on your profile but read in your comment that you do.

This isn‚Äôt really a profile review, just some perspective as someone older with a similar-ish background/demographic. The issue isn‚Äôt your profile. It‚Äôs good. What you‚Äôre running in to is a function of your age and the things your male peers do and don‚Äôt prioritize. You will always run in to guys looking for casual.

Something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre still in Texas is that a lot of how people identify here is cultural more than it is functional. People will put down Christian conservative because that‚Äôs the prevailing cultural thing here. A lot of people here consider themselves Christian and do not go to church. A lot will knee jerk put conservative and have never once voted or thought about politics very critically. It‚Äôs momentum, if that makes sense.

You already put your political affiliation, and beyond that, there's nothing else you can do except to again, filter, because many men (especially the casual ones) will not care if you're politically incompatible (they're probably not even reading your profile), and you may also live in a location where your dating pool is very conservative to begin with.",Positive

I'm not sure what your sexual desires and needs are, but if you feel that you will be sexually satisfied by just one gender or the other without the need for both in your life, you might consider changing your profile to say ""lesbian"" for a few weeks, then ""straight"" for a few weeks.

I'll be honest. I asked for a review on this subreddit and I got torn apart because I said I was studying Arabic. I was told that hobby was too esoteric and I should remove it from my profile in order to appeal to the masses. I don't want to date the masses. They also assumed I was studying Arabic because I only want to marry an Arab dude. That was a weird bit of projection on their part. I think a lot of people are going to tell you to remove the parts of your profile that illustrate who you are and who you're looking for in order to make your profile more generic and inflate your number of matches. Your quantity of matches won't matter if none of them are the quality match you're looking for. And if you make your profile too basic, the more interesting girls are going to assume you're boring and swipe left. A lot of guys say online dating is strictly a numbers game, but it's only a numbers game if you have all the same generic interests as everyone else and you're just looking for literally anyone who is willing to date you. Past that I think it's all about strategy and marketing yourself to the people in your area who are a good fit for you.

As for the photos, I see that you're shutting down every single comment about your grainy photos, but seriously, it helps to have clear photos. Or at least have 3 clear ones. You can use the same phone, you just need better lighting. The photos look old and dated and people might also think you don't look like that anymore. 

Add some variety as well - as these are all selfies. Which could give the impression that you care too much about looks/you're vain (no hate if you're like that) but it may attract the kind of men who only care about that as well. 

You rambled on about not having a full-length mirror when asked about a full-body photo - set up your phone somewhere and take a photo using the self-timer. (But also, full-length mirrors are amazing to have!)

Having one photo with friends shows that, yes, you have friends but even more so - it shows you are sociable and will off-set the impression of being self-absorbed (due to all the selfies). It also shows a different facet of your life, who you hang-out with, etc. 

Have an activity photo. You mentioned in the comments you don't do anything. Which is okay, fair, you do you. But what do you enjoy? What is interesting about you and your life? Have a friend take even just a photo in a coffee shop or a store or at a park with your dog. 

Think of profiles as a way to communicate what you're like but also attract the kind of people that you want. You're not going to do that successfully with a bunch of grainy selfies.

If you really want to make your eyes stand out, do a little eye brow powder so they look more defined. Tinted chapstick can do wonders for the lips without it being an annoyance like lipstick is. 

I know how much easier it is to hide your body than it is to embrace it. Oversized clothing on women who aren‚Äôt a size 2 kind of give off insecure vibes which men might not like. You can still dress casually while show casing your curves!

Despite people‚Äôs reluctance to admit it, numerous analytics have shown that most men typically have a much harder time getting success on dating apps, which is why I encourage men to get OFF dating apps and jump INTO real life. 

If you can manage to do it right and get over any possible fear/anxiety you may have associated with it, meeting women in real life really is the way to go for men. So few men do it that it‚Äôs an easy way to stand out in the crowd and it displays a certain level of confidence that women are inherently attracted to (as long as you do it right). If nothing else, it builds your character and social skills by forcing you to repeatedly step outside of your comfort zone. Don‚Äôt do pick up artistry or anything like that, but do get comfortable with talking to women you find attractive. If you do keep a dating app, just keep it for small time gains on the side.

A prompt that describes the kind of person you're looking for, or showing the kind of qualities you have implies that the person is looking for something for serious for me. 


Little nitpicky things - for your job, I would suggest deleting the s off analysts, and tweak the killer whale prompt slightly if you want to keep it since it wasn't clear on the first read.

First one could be a more formal/biz casual photo: you‚Äôre a financial analyst so I assume you dress up well for work (or just have a photo taken at a wedding where you‚Äôre in a suit/dress shirt that fits well).

Another photo could be a pic with some friends.  You‚Äôre tall so you will stand out well.

Otherwise you might be getting left swiped because people are assuming you're something you aren't.

For the first prompt, try pivoting to a prompt that allows you to portray an example of your humor rather than listing out these descriptors that often conjure negative impressions (but finding the balance of not TOO dark for a first opener, and not self deprecating in a way that conveys lack of confidence). 

The second response really shouldn‚Äôt be merged into the same prompt, as these two elements are unrelated. 

I‚Äôm a big Harry Potter fan, but I‚Äôm still confused how a room of requirement reference counts as an overshare. That would better fit with the ‚Äúa random fact I love‚Äù prompt. That being said, if Harry Potter fandom is the important thing to convey, pivot to a prompt that expresses the fact that you‚Äôre a fan in a lighthearted way (e.g. My most irrational fear = someone using the Sectumsempra curse on me‚Äù).

I don‚Äôt think listing that you‚Äôre an INTJ counts as an overshare either, a better way to convey the message around that is to pick a prompt that demonstrates what it‚Äôs like to date you because you‚Äôre an INTJ (preferably not in a self deprecating way üòâ)

Agreed that the hotel picture isn't a good sign, especially as your first image. It's also a bit blurry anyways so I'd swap it out with a picture of you smiling. 

I actually think the gym selfie is good, especially if you do go to the gym. The problem with gym photos usually is either their whole pfoile is about the gym or its just not a good photo, but neither are true in your case.

Also the photo with woman next to you is fine because there are others in the photo; it's only an issue if it's unclear if you're already in a relationship. I'd take it as a green flag that you're able to be friends with a woman; you'd be surprised how often that's not the case.

One minor edit, your second prompt is too wordy. I had trouble getting through it. I'd just take out the ""I believe that"" so its just through good conversation...

Best if luck!

Also I really hope you didn't spend your birthday is prison haha. That last prompt is definitely a good conversation starter.",Positive

 There are those who might say that you should replace the pictures uniform and the gym picture for the sake of getting more matches, I get the impression that both are actually central to your self-identity and those matches you lose would be poor ones, so no loss really.

If there were a picture that I would consider replacing, it would be your current first one, the setting looks to posed in a hotel room and the group picture where you are sitting next to the young woman.  I am sure totally innocent but if it's a toss up between yourself and someone very similar they don't have to wonder about what's going on there, why surrender the edge?

 In fact that being said were it my profile, I would edit out every face but my own in the group pictures, even if you have talked with the other people in the pictures about using them in this manner I can see how some people would this as oversharing information, and be concerned about what they can trust you with.",Positive

I think your first two prompts are pretty good. The second one, the wording is a little bit awkward but I like what you‚Äôre saying. 

The third prompt is what‚Äôs throwing me off. I‚Äôm not a big fan of two truths and a lie in general, and dating online for women is such a fraught, dangerous thing that if there is ANY chance you‚Äôve been to prison, it‚Äôs going to make me scared. Every girl I know has a terrifying story about something going sideways meeting people from the Internet, and in my case, I actually had a guy break into my house months later and try to kill me after I rejected him. Even the hint that maybe you‚Äôve been to prison would make me scared that you could be dangerous, especially combined with the fact that you‚Äôre clearly in peak physical condition. 

To be clear, prison wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a dealbreaker depending on the details IF I knew you in person and it was for something like a non  violent drug offense. Our justice system is a travesty. But if there‚Äôs any chance that you had been to prison for something violent and there‚Äôs a question mark hanging in the air, I‚Äôd swipe left.

597,"like, profile, would, one, ","A couple thoughts:

1. Photos are all good individually, but I think you look significantly older in the first and fourth photos than you do in the other photos. Assuming your other photos are equally recent, the lighting in those two photos makes it look like you're starting to gray and would make me worry that you're lying about your age. (That said, there are also people who go gray young, so it's not necessarily an immediate red flag -- but if you're *not* going gray I'd consider switching those up.) 
2. I don't really think your prompts tell me that much about you other than that you travel. Generally I don't think ""best travel story"" is a great prompt to use, because the best stories are usually longer than what you can fit in a Hinge prompt. If there's more to the story, you can give a sort of teaser for it and tell matches to ask you for the rest. The second prompt is kind of quirky and gives people an opener but, again, doesn't tell me much about you or what you're looking for -- I have mixed feelings on that one. The last prompt is something I see a lot, and it's a step above ""tell me about yourself"" but it's still a really broad catch-all prompt and wouldn't really inspire me to send a message since I feel like I know so little about you from the profile prompts. I think it could work better to mention something you've been enjoying and asking the question back to matches.",Positive

So basically, your range of men are hardcore conservative or conspiracy nuts, who at the same time have no issue with their woman being a sex worker, and looking for what I presume a monogamous relationship that leads to marriage. All I have to say is the supply of attractive men who fits all those criteria are quite‚Ä¶ small. Most normal people see your beliefs and behavior as giant red flags.

This prompt is also not suitable for a dating app, where the initial interaction will always be a small talk. That kinda scares the people away.

3) Your third prompt about laughter is very weak and generic. But your second prompt about travel is good. It can be worked on to either omit ghost part or rephrase ghost part to like ‚Äúask me about how we found our way back!‚Äù To let people approach you and open a conversation.

- in your prompt you say ""hope you're not too annoyed if I fall asleep"" - try rephrasing that in a more positive light. Something like 'hope you find it cute if..."". You don't want to evoke negative emotions with your profile.

- your pictures all read as neutral to sad. Do you have/can you take other photos where you're smiling?

804,"like, profile, would, one, ","I‚Äôve read a few of the comments above so this is written with those in mind and may also be a bit repetitive. 

With kindness, I do think some tweaking to the make up could be great! You have a fantastic canvas to work with, as your skin is lovely. You have a unique style, which is awesome, so I hope you don‚Äôt feel like anyone is suggesting you step away from that but on the make up front here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed:
- The foundation needs a bit more dimension. I too have pale Irish skin, so I understand the struggle. I must say though, your skin looks beautifully smooth! If you could play around with some light contour/highlighting, it would help to make your skin look a bit more like skin after the foundation is applied. It‚Äôs really tricky to get right, as it does require layering up. Although the general rule of thumb should always be less is more for a subtle look, you may need to have a couple of light layers like foundation/blush/highlight/powder, which can actually weirdly help the foundation to look less caked on. Unfortunately, I think make up is one of those products where you need to level up with more expensive products for best results!
- You have gorgeous pink hair but when us fair skinned ladies have dyed hair (I‚Äôve had firetruck red, cherry, blush pink, lavender etc), we usually need a bit of mascara to make the eyes pop and help us to not look too washed out - I don‚Äôt know why mascara makes such a big difference but it does. It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything heavy but even a light coating of the lashes can really make a huge difference! 
- The lipstick is a little too pigmented and I would agree with another comment that a tinted chapstick or even a less matt shade would look stunning on you! 

The profile itself is a good profile in my opinion in terms of authentic yet playful responses to the prompts. I am sorry you aren‚Äôt getting matches, it‚Äôs really tough out there. I do find Hinge is one of the hardest - I don‚Äôt buy their tagline ‚Äòdesigned to be deleted‚Äô at all. I‚Äôve been single for years and used Hinge from quite early on, I‚Äôve seen them evolve the app into one that has increasing paywalls and less access to higher quantities of matches. I feel your pain but the quality of Hinge users is better; so it‚Äôs a bit of a waiting game! If it‚Äôs within your budget I‚Äôd recommend paying to be a preferred member for a month so you can cast a wider net. Or you could use Hinge alongside some of the less heavily paywalled apps, like POF, Tinder etc. 

I think you could improve your range of pics. The odd group pic does help to show that you have a social life if you can find one you like (even just with 1/2 pals). It‚Äôs also good to have a hobby pic, your pics do reflect your interests but maybe you could have a more dynamic one of you out there engaging in something, like idk at a coffee shop or a bar. It‚Äôs good to have some variation of back drops. It looks a little bit like most of these pics were all taken on the same day or outing, which to me suggests either the profile was made in a hurry or you don‚Äôt go out much (I‚Äôm not suggesting either is the case, that‚Äôs just the vibe it sends out when someone has several pics from the same occasion). 

It would be lovely to see one of you outdoors or just with a different backdrop. You mentioned your friends don‚Äôt take good pictures of you in a comment above, this is where you need to be bold - tell them you need photos for a dating app and ask for help. Ask your friends to show you the pictures afterwards so you can learn more about the posing/angles and if you aren‚Äôt happy, ask if they‚Äôll snap a couple more. I know it can feel a bit awkward and embarrassing at first, especially in public. However, it really does pay off! I‚Äôve been much more direct with my friends that when I ask them to take a pic of me I might use it for a dating app and sometimes they roll their eyes a bit when I ask for multiple takes but mostly it‚Äôs good fun and I have at least one or two shots I like. 

Finally, I‚Äôd recommend hiding your last name from your profile if that is the name you use professionally, just for safety reasons!

Your photo backgrounds could be more diverse. You are either on the water or at home in all of them, add one or two of you traveling. Also, your outfits are all casual, add at least one formal picture (not black tie, but dressed nicely, such as a wedding). 

Having a pic with your dog is awesome, but low angle shots are not flattering, so consider replacing that one with a better one set to a timer or have one taken by a friend. Remove the ""me in the wild"" double prompt. Consider completely rewriting the ""I know the best spot in town"" prompt. I suggest avoiding talking about shattered ankles.

Your lead shot is good.  Picture 3 is also good (above vibe prompt).

The full body shot #2 is ok but the sunglasses diminish it.

The devil costume picture is not good.  Costumes are overused on women's profiles in this demographic and TBH never add much to the profile.  It also suggests a different body type than your other pictures.  This sets up a conflict in my mind about which pictures are the most current.

Last face shot is inferior to others due to hat and sunglasses.

Your other two prompts both basically tell me that you're willing to be spontaneous and take risks. That's really valuable info as it's a huge plus to some people and kind of a dealbreaker to others, but a little redundant. I think I'd keep the first. If you can fit it, maybe add something about whether you'd like to move again in the future or if you're putting down roots with this clinic. I'm not a risk taker so mine may not be the most valuable perspective on this, but a lot of people may have strong feelings about their career, family, or just a city like NY and may be hesitant to get seriously involved with someone who wants to move around every few years. Use your 3rd prompt to tell people either what you're looking for in a partner, something else about yourself, or ask a question that will be an easy conversation starter for the kid of person you're looking to attract.

If you actually climb a lot and its a big enough part of your life, maybe add a climbing pic? Even better a sick video?

Prune down your second prompt: id get rid of the generics: workings out, 'going with the flow', 'traveling' (everyone says they like traveling, your pics already say that, as well as your 1st and 3rd prompt). Leaning towards also taking out pillow talking... I know it can be/feel genuine, but its an insinuation at the end of the day lmao Also i think everyone on dating apps 'love deep convos', so id drop it

Your first pic is good, but it was a little jarring finding out you are bald, so maybe dont lead with it. Another reason not to lead with it, is it looks/feels weird to me.. like is it edited or something? Is it older? Your jawline looks more pronounced and your face looks thinner, idk.. great pic though

tbh second pic isnt doing it for me. usually second pic should show of your general body type. I have a general idea, but a more well-lit photo of you sitting, or preferably standing might help

If you have a better photo, drop the ferris wheel. nice smile, just doesnt tell me much other than you can smile and ride ferris wheels lol 

Same with the dog pic, switch it out if you have a better pic: I get it, dogs get likes, but if its not yours and/or if it doesnt live with you it might just lead to disappointment lmao Also tbh it doesnt flatter you that much either imo

\- I don't think the photo of you at a wedding adds value. You look way too serious and blacking out the woman is distracting. It's a good idea to clean yourself up and wear something nice, but wedding photos aren't ideal.  
\- Always look at the camera in your pictures.  
\- I do not recommend any snakes in any photos. Snakes are creepy and I can't see a woman commenting on it.  
\- add captions to your photos.  
\- The fact you did a voice prompt is a plus!  
\- Your prompts are dry. You put effort into them which is good but lack depth. For me, humor is an effective way to prompt women to connect with you.   
\- Your grizzly bear story is intriguing. Maybe rephrase it to get a woman to message you. ""While hiking in Glacier National Park I came face to face with a Grizzly Bear. You will NOT believe what happened next...""    
\- I get best along with - add more about what you're looking for. Bold, passionate, and honest are OK but you want a woman to read this thinking to herself, ""Yes! He's talking about me!"" Remove don't be shy about yourself. Include exciting things you enjoy doing that appeal to women.",Positive

I think you should replace the mirror selfies. If you can, get a friend to take a couple headshots; if not, you can usually find a phone tripod for pretty cheap and set it on a timer or on a continuous shot mode (single take on android, live photo on iphone). I also think the last photo is taken too far away for it to be a good dating app photo. The graduation photo doesn't have great lighting but it shows something important to you; if you're more than a year past graduation, I'd recommend swapping it out. The robotics team (I'm guessing?) photo is fun and shows something you're passionate about. Definitely the best photo on your profile is the second one; I wouldn't make it your first photo, but I think it's a cool full body shot that shows off your style well.

One problem with being specific about what you're reading is it invites the question of if that was written yesterday, 6 months ago, etc. If you're still listed as ""new here,"" then that answers that question, but after that first week, anyone seeing your profile will have no idea if that answer is still relevant or if it has become stale.

(Also, as an aside, I probably wouldn't X a profile outright for mentioning reading Dawkins but it could tip things if I were on the fence‚Äîeven though I'm an atheist and into reading non-fiction science books (and had gone through a Dawkins phase in my late teens), Dawkins' style of being a 'public intellectual' is pretty divisive and you might fare better leaving that to a later discussion)

I disagree about taking the poledance instructor thing off your profile. I think it's important to be upfront about that hobby and if you get negative responses, that just helps you weed out the men who can't respect a perfectly acceptable art/form of exercise.
